### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, was a favorite because I was always curious on how code was ever created
    and even how you could start you own code. It made me more curious and entertained
    throughout this whole semester. 

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was another of my favorites because it really showed me teh basics and
    how to use modular programming in my own code. As the first lad that had me use and
    learn how to used static_cast for conversion of numbers. 

* Lab 11 

    Lab 11, was yet another one of my favorites because it taught me how to still finish a
    lab without direct instruction. Leaving me and my partner to learn from our own note
    and mind to configure our own code for the function bodies.
